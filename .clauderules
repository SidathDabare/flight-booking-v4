# Claude Code Rules

## File Organization

- All completed task documentation files (*.md) should be automatically placed in `.claude/completed-tasks/` folder
- Task reports, integration guides, improvement documentation, and audit reports belong in `.claude/completed-tasks/`
- Do not create documentation .md files in the root directory unless they are core project files like README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md
